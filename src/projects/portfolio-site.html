                <h3>What inspired your site design?</h3>

                <p>I have nearly 2500 hours in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304410/Hexcells_Infinite/" target="_blank">Hexcells</a>, a minesweeper game set in hexagons. Many of its visual elements inspired my website design: the color choice, thin font styling, and emphasis on minimalism.</p>

                <p>I believe strongly in simple, intuitive, and interactive user interfaces.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Why from scratch?</h3>

                <p>My experience with <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">SquareSpace</a> was simple and short - I found the interface stifling.</p>

                <p>The templates were certainly cool and organized. But I wanted a little more - I wanted to make something that would make people say "Wow, I've never seen that before."</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>My website had humble beginnings - I wanted it to be easy to make, easy for the eye, and filled with my latest obsession: hexagons.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The industrial grey background, sharp-cut corners, and grid-based format of each page gave the sense of <b>organization</b> and <b>control</b>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I had originally wanted to frame each relevant image in a hexagon, but quickly realized that it would be 1) difficult to code and 2) hard to frame certain things.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I switched to using rectangles, but realized that my page looked <b>generic</b>. Sure, everything was in the right place, but it felt too "empty", expression-wise.</p>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div>
                <p>One topic that came up frequently when receiving feedback was how the landing page expressed that "I am a gamer, composer, and designer."</p>
                <p>There was little on the website besides a few projects and the statement itself that expressed that I was the gamer I said I was.</p>
                <p>My <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/magix430" target="_blank">Steam profile</a> showed that I loved games more than my site did, but how would I carry it over?</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>It was back to the drawing board. Once creative and personal expression entered the equation, I knew that building the website would no longer be easy.</p>
                <p>I wanted to make my website a game by itself - you'd win by visiting the page and having fun, you'd lose by... not visiting it, I suppose :) </p>
            </div>

            <div class="fullWidthRow"></div>

            <div>
                <p>The first challenge came from figuring out what I had to work with.</p>
                <p>I had some prior experience working in webpages (HTML/CSS) but very little coding experience in terms of Javascript, React, Gatsby, ...etc.</p>
                <p>I looked through several online assets and found several useful tools like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">JSFiddle</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.</p>
                <p>My browsers quickly filled with tabs of these two services.</p>
            </div>
            <div>

                <p>They were live-development code editors, meaning that you could see what you were making - and many people had many projects to share.</p>
                <p>The main challenge was that the assets I desired - hexagons, minimaps, hover-effects - often had outdated or defunct code.</p>
                <p>I either had to search harder or learn a bit of code.</p>
            </div>
