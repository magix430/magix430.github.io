                <h3>What is Cat Quest?</h3>

                <p>Cat Quest is a mobile application designed to make exploring the Northwestern University campus more exciting and fun for incoming freshmen. It combines elements of augmented reality (AR) and gaming to encourage building relationships and team spirit. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What was your role?</h3>

                <p>Cat Quest was the product of a group project for a class on UX Design, for which our group had to devise a solution for common Northwestern campus issues. I helped co-conduct user interviews, designed prototype screens, and created the wireframe for our final presentation of the app.</p>

                <p>We conducted user interviews to gather insight from both freshmen and upperclassmen on their Wildcat Welcome experience and PA group relationships.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>We found that PA group relations varied greatly due to differences in community activity. Some groups met often over the course of the quarter, others scarcely met.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>We learned that Wildcat Welcome was often too hectic to warm up to surroundings, and most students didn't bother to explore beyond where their classes required them to be.</p>

                <p>Cat Quest utilizes NetID login to connect fellow teammates in PA groups. Teams can customize their team names at the beginning of Wildcat Welcome, before the Quest begins.</p>
                <p>A live update feed keeps teams in-the-know for who is closest to first place and to keep track of points towards the rewards system.</p>

                <p>Cat Quest combines familiar interfaces like Snapchat and Pokemon GO! for a modern, game-like feel.</p>
                <p>Users interact with their surroundings by navigating to unexplored locations and snapping a photo of the location token. Using a GPS feed, extra points are rewarded if teams are travelling together.</p>

                </div>
                <p>For each day in Wildcat Welcome, a physical key token is planted somewhere on campus, accompanied by a riddle sent to each teams' PA. The first team to find and redeem the key code receive a substantial boost in points.</p>
                <p>Daily rewards are granted to the top 3 unique teams (have not been rewarded before), and at the end of Wildcat Welcome, valuable merchandise are rewarded to the final standings.</p>

                <p>Our team was not experienced in coding, and thus implementation was not possible. All drafts were created in Adobe XD, Photoshop, and video prototypes were created in After Effects.</p>
                <p>We were unable to provide a price estimate for pursuing the rewards system - pictures shown in the wireframe/screen-deliverables are all purely conceptual.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Our ideas met positive criticism from both freshmen and upperclassmen. Feedback remained positive whether implications of the rewards system was presented at the beginning or after the storyboard was described.</p>
                <p>Some users were skeptical of how this program would encourage cooperation among those who aren't inclined to participate in general and how it would affect the team's chance of winning. We were unable to provide reasonable explanations in favor or against the idea.</p>
